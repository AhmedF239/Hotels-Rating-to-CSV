"# Hotels-Rating-to-CSV" 

"This code is a Python script that scrapes hotel data from Booking.com for hotels in Hurghada and saves the data to a CSV file. The script uses the requests library to send a request to the URL and get the page content, then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content. It extracts the data of the first 10 hotels, including the hotel name, review score, rating value, and number of reviews, and writes this data to a CSV file named "booking.csv"."
